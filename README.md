# MobDev Test
   
Do `npm install` to install node_modules and `npm start` to run the server.

For development mode run `npm run develop` and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) will be run allowing you to listen to file changes.

To run tests simply run `npm test`. Used [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
